# cystoscopy-image-datasets
Publicly available cystoscopy image datasets. Some extracted from videoes

## Olympus
Extracted from Olympus' cystoscopy video library. Used FreeVideoToJPGConverter (outputing every frame) and manually removed frames that are too dim or irrelevant to the endoscopy 
procedure. Most images contain subtitles that may entail further preprocessing or can be used toward annotation.
This folder contains sample images. The whole dataset of images is too large to upload to github.

Please contact me at saturnino at berkeley dot edu if you know other publicly available cystoscopy datasets or need more samples.
